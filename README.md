# network-traffic-analysis-task-5
This project is part of my Cyber Security Internship – Task 5, focusing on real-time network traffic analysis using Wireshark, a powerful packet capturing tool. The objective was to monitor live network activity, identify key protocols, and understand the types of data exchanged during everyday communication on a local network.

## 📌 Objective

The purpose of this task was to capture real-time network activity using **Wireshark** and analyze common protocols and traffic types involved in everyday network communication.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Wireshark** – A powerful, open-source network protocol analyzer used for capturing and inspecting packet-level data.

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `task5_capture.pcapng` – Packet capture log file recorded during the session.
- `task5_report.txt` – A summary document outlining the observed protocols and key insights from the captured data.

---

## 🔍 Protocols Detected

The following protocols were identified in the traffic capture:

- **ARP** – Resolving MAC addresses on the local network.
- **DNS** – Resolving hostnames to IP addresses.
- **TCP** – Ensures reliable communication.
- **UDP** – Connectionless communication for lightweight data transfer.
- **HTTP** – Plain text web browsing.
- **HTTPS** – Secure encrypted web communication.
- **ICMP** – Used for ping and network diagnostics.

---

## 🔎 Key Observations

- Multiple **DNS lookups** were observed for website resolution.
- Both **HTTP and HTTPS** traffic indicated web usage during the capture.
- **ICMP Echo** requests and replies confirmed active ping tests.
- **TCP handshakes** and established sessions indicated stable data communication.
- ARP activity revealed device discovery within the local subnet.

## 📆 Date of Capture

> July 1, 2025

---

## 📢 Notes

This task was conducted as part of a **Cyber Security Internship Program** to develop hands-on experience in traffic inspection and protocol analysis. The skills acquired during this task aid in understanding how data travels across networks and how various protocols function at different OSI layers.
