# network-traffic-analysis-task-5
This project is part of my Cyber Security Internship â€“ Task 5, focusing on real-time network traffic analysis using Wireshark, a powerful packet capturing tool. The objective was to monitor live network activity, identify key protocols, and understand the types of data exchanged during everyday communication on a local network.
